1. Semi-Tokenization:
	Include whitespaces, identifiers (var, func and const) and unknown
	Report where first unknown semi token is located
	Group semi tokens of same type together (excepet parentheses)
	Validate parentheses
2. Full-Tokenization:
	Iterate through every semi token 
	Categorize identifiers
	Validate numbers, operators and former identifiers
3. (Modified) Shunting-Yard Algorithm:
	Infix to postfix conversion

4. Evaluation:
	Calculate value of postfix expression
